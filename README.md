# Appointment Booking System (C++)

A simple yet structured appointment booking system developed in C++ as part of the CS2111 Data Structures & Algorithms course at Effat University, Spring 2025.

## 🔧 Features

- Add new appointments with ID, name, date, time, and specialty
- Manage appointments using:
  - Queue (FIFO) for active appointments
  - Stack for undo functionality
  - Linked List for completed appointments
  - Binary Search Tree (BST) for date-sorted viewing
- Search for appointments by date
- View all, completed, and sorted appointments

## 🧱 Data Structures Used

- **Array**: for storing queue data
- **Linked List**: for completed and undo stacks
- **Stack**: for undo deleted appointments
- **Queue**: for managing upcoming appointments
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: for storing and searching appointments by date

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Dynamic memory management
- Class and struct design
- Tree traversal and insertion
- Modular programming
- OOP in C++
